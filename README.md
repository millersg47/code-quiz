# CODE-QUIZ

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This webpage is a Javascript code quiz meant to test a beginner developer's understanding of the Javascript language. When the user clicks the "start quiz" button, a timer starts and the first question appears with multiple choice answers. The user chooses their answer and then the next question appears. Below the next question, a message appears to tell the user if they chose the correct or wrong answer for the previous question. Once all questions are answered, a form appears where the user can submit their initials for the scores record. 

The webpage is linked [here] (https://millersg47.github.io/code-quiz/).
